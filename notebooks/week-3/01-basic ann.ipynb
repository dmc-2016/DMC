    "\n",
    "Here we will build a very rudimentary Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and use it to solve some basic classification problems. This example is implemented using only basic math and linear algebra functions, which will allow us to study how each aspect of the network works, and to gain an intuitive understanding of its functions. In future labs we will use pre-built libraries such as Keras which automate and optimize much of these functions, making the network much faster and easier to use.\n",

In order to work with our functions, the data needs to be converted to numpy format, split into feature and target sets, and then recombined as separate lists within a single dataset. Finally, we split the data set into training and testing sets, and convert the targets of the training set to 'one-hot' encoding (OHE). OHE takes each piece of categorical data and converts it to a list of binary values the length of which is equal to the number of categories, and the position of the current category denoted with a '1' and '0' for all others. For example, in our dataset we have 3 possible categories: versicolor, virginica, and setosa. After applying OHE, versicolor becomes [1,0,0], virginica becomes [0,1,0], and setosa becomes [0,0,1]. OHE is a standard format for target data as it allows easy application of the cost function during training."
